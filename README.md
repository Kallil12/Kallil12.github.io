## Welcome to my Page on Github

If you are here it's probably because you want to know a little about me, so let's get to that.

I'm a bachelor at Science and Technology, and right now I'm a undergrad in Computer Engineering. Since I was studying Science and Technology I fell in love with Probability and Statistcs, so I started to run after that as a career. Studying Data Science tools, R, Python, SQL and other stuff alike became a must, I'm still on it and I guess that it will never stop. To be updated is a constant work, so one can never say it's finished. In 2014 I traveled to the USA and studiend 2 semesters at Widener University, this year was very important to me because it made my mind about computer engineering as the best option for me (my options back then were Mechanical, Materials, Computer and Petroleum Engineering). I came back to Brazil, finished Science and Technology and started Computer Engineering 2 years later. 

Right now I'm working with Business Intelligence at "Justi√ßa Federal do Rio Grande do Norte" or Federal Justice. I'm helping creating some dashboards to help the managers of public resources to better understand how much and where the money is being spent, how many processes are stuck and where and other stuff that will take too much space here. Also, I'm working a bit with Python as a webscrapper to automatize some mechanical activities, so a bot made with Python is doing some stuff around here.

As a hobby I try to fix some old computers, mainly ThinkPads (they are just awesome), and cars, one day I will have a Porsche 911 82' and write about that here (just wait and see). But these are talks to another day.
